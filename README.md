# Voice Controlled React News Application

Uses Alan AI Voice Interface, ReactJS, Axios and currently being extended to use Redux for data storage and state mapping

Use conversational voice commands to request the latest headlines, news on certain topics or from specific sources or parts of the world. The conversational aspect of this app was my main drive: speak as you would normally. The application was made to understand your commands and respond as any friend or neighbor would as you chat about current events.

## Introduction
This is a code repository for the corresponding video tutorial.

In this app, I've built a Conversational Voice Controlled React News Application using Alan AI. Alan AI is a revolutionary speech recognition software that allows you to add voice capabilities to your applications. Voice scripts are written in JavaScript, which makes them highly customizable and flexible. This app was created in React and uses NewsApi.org to access the latest headlines from all the major sources.

## Setup:

run `npm i && npm start` to start development server

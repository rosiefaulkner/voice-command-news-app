# Voice Controlled React News Application
## Uses Alan AI Voice Interface

## Introduction
This is a code repository for the corresponding video tutorial.

In this app, I've built a Conversational Voice Controlled React News Application using Alan AI. Alan AI is a revolutionary speech recognition software that allows you to add voice capabilities to your applications. Voice scripts are written in JavaScript, which makes them highly customizable and flexible. This app was created in React and uses NewsApi.org to access the latest headlines from all the major sources.

## Setup:

run `npm i && npm start` to start development server
